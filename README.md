* I used the built-in http server module in python, and used the docs here to get started. `https://docs.python.org/3/library/http.server.html`
* I glanced at this website, which details the code structure of a simple httpserver implementation in python, but I did not copy any of the code aside from that which was used in the official python documentation. `https://stackabuse.com/serving-files-with-pythons-simplehttpserver-module/`
